# Scavenger Mobile

This is an experimental frontend to make it easier to mine Burstcoin using Scavenger on Android.

This is simply a wrapper for Scavenger, and will provide a simple configuration interface for Scavenger as well as automatically manage a background service that runs Scavenger.

This project is currently under development.
